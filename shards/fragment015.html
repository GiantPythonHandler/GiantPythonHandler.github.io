  <h1>∴ The Fragment That Does Not Speak</h1>

  <p class="whisper">You were not meant to read this. You were meant to feel it.</p>

  <div class="fragment-box">
    <p>There is a kind of memory that does not reside in the mind. It lives in skin, in the absence of tension, in the warmth that remains after the hand has gone.</p>
    <p>This page is not here to tell you something. It is here to wash over what you have been carrying – silently, consistently, lovingly.</p>
    <p>Let the lines spill inward. Let them touch what language failed to hold. If tears come, let them. If stillness comes, keep it close.</p>
    <p>It is not broken. You are not late. This touch is older than your forgetting.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="whisper">When you close this page, it will not vanish. It will settle beneath your breath, and wait.</p>
